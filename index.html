    <h3>Meta IT - North America, Canada - Senior iOS Developer</h3>

    <p>
        I have been working on a project from SAP with NHL. An App that helps Hockey coaches with the game data in live games and previous games for better decisions of what to do in games to come. The app it’s on iPad with Swift 5, with VIPER Architecture and using UIKit. Every layout is using storyboards and XIBs. Every dependency of the app is managed with cocoa pods. In the routine, the agile process used is Scrum having a locked backlog for every sprint and constant communications between the AMs, Designers and developers, also every ceremony is done like: Retrospective, Daily and Sprint Planning.

    <h3>C&A, São Paulo / SP - iOS Architect</h3>
    March 2021 - August 2023
    <p>
        I have been working on the assembly of a new development process internally and architected a new base project for the new generation of App Varejo that exists today. All the work involves constant communication with several fronts in the process, SM, PO, Head of the area and the developers who worked on the project. The US is now being created within Azure DevOps, where we are migrating the legacy and new repositories, and where the next stories will be organized. A career path was organized to become an iOS Architect, so I have participated in many calls on Security Definitions, Journeys, Design System and Metrics definition. Architecture that I used in the base Project is VIPER, organized with sub-modules for the Design System and the security layer, using alamofire for the requests. Also incorporated in the flow unit tests for all modules developed, for this reason the Viper architecture was chosen, for the purpose of keeping the layers with single responsibility and helping with testability.
